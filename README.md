# Countdown
Created with HTML/CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

## overview
A countdown works by counting down from a specified time interval to zero, typically in seconds. The process is often automated, and the countdown updates in real-time based on the current time and the specified end time.

## How it works?
Set the start and end times: The countdown is programmed to start counting down from a specific start time and stop at a specified end time.

The countdown calculates the amount of time remaining between the current time and the end time. This is typically done using JavaScript.

This is shown in seconds, minutes, or hours.

Once the countdown reaches zero, it ends and displaying a message announcing the end of the countdown.
